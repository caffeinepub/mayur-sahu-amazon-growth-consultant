- **Services Section:** Replace existing section with four grouped service category cards ("Amazon Growth & Management", "Brand Development", "Emergency Services", "eBay Management"), each with gold-accented numbered header, gold Lucide icon, glassmorphism styling, and staggered scroll-triggered slide-up animations.
- **Pricing Section:** Replace existing section with three glassmorphism tier cards ("Starter" $499/mo, "Growth" $999/mo with elevated "Most Popular" gold badge, "Elite" $1,999/mo), scarcity text ("Minimum 3-month commitment", "Limited onboarding slots available"), custom plans note, and gold CTA buttons scrolling to the Strategy Call section.
- **Case Studies Section (new):** Add section after Pricing with three sample client cards showing animated Recharts before/after bar charts and count-up number reveals for key metrics (ACOS, revenue, conversion), using glassmorphism dark gold theme and scroll-triggered fade-in.
- **Testimonials Section (new):** Add section after Case Studies with five sample testimonial cards, each showing client name, country flag emoji (🇺🇸/🇬🇧), review quote, and 5 gold star rating, with staggered scroll-triggered entrance animations and gold border styling.
- **About/Founder Section:** Update heading to "Meet The Founder", display name and title "Amazon & Ecommerce Growth Consultant", add five credential lines with gold checkmark icons, retain headshot with gold corner accents, and add scroll-triggered slide-in animations for both columns.
- **Why Choose Section:** Update with five differentiator glassmorphism cards covering direct expert access, cost savings, limited slots, performance-driven approach, and long-term partnership, with gold Lucide icons and staggered scroll-triggered animations.
- **Strategy Call Section:** Update headline to "Book Your Free 30-Minute Amazon Growth Strategy Call", add supporting text, large gold "Schedule Call Now" button, green WhatsApp CTA button with MessageCircle icon, email contact form (Name, Email, Amazon Store URL, Submit), retain Calendly placeholder, and apply visually distinct background.
- **Navigation:** Add links for all sections (Home, About, Services, Pricing, Case Studies, Testimonials, Book Call), smooth-scroll to correct section IDs, update mobile hamburger menu, retain sticky dark styling and gold "Book Call" CTA button.
- **Global Animations & Polish:** Apply scroll-triggered fade-in/slide-up to all sections via IntersectionObserver, staggered card/list entrance animations, gold shimmer/pulse keyframe on all primary CTA buttons, hover micro-animations (scale + glow) on all cards, animated visual pathway/step-connector between Problem → Services → Pricing → Strategy Call sections, and consistent glassmorphism (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent dark background, gold border) on all cards.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a fully upgraded single-page consulting site with new Problem, Case Studies, and Testimonials sections, a 3-tier pricing layout, enhanced hero with particle animations, premium glassmorphism cards throughout, and smooth scroll-triggered animations guiding them toward the Strategy Call conversion section.
