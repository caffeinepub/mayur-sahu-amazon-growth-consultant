# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the About section headshot with a new photo of Mayur Sahu, add a gold crown emoji to the ProSellers brand name in the navigation bar, and increase all footer content font sizes for better readability.

**Planned changes:**
- In `AboutSection.tsx`, replace the existing headshot image with the newly generated `mayur-sahu-headshot-new.dim_400x500.png`; all layout, gold corner accents, and animations remain unchanged
- In `Navigation.tsx`, add a gold-colored 👑 crown emoji immediately before the "ProSellers" brand name text in the logo area
- In `Footer.tsx`, increase font sizes for all footer content lines (brand line, global serving line, timezone line, India-based line, and copyright notice) while preserving the dark background, text colors, and centered alignment

**User-visible outcome:** The About section displays the new Mayur Sahu headshot, the navigation bar logo reads "👑 ProSellers" with a gold crown, and all footer text is noticeably larger and more readable.
