# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace all brand/company name references across the landing page with "ProSellers".

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Navigation bar logo/brand text to "ProSellers"
- Update the Footer to read "ProSellers — Amazon Growth Consultant"
- Update the HTML `<title>` tag in index.html to "ProSellers | Amazon Growth Consultant"
- Replace any remaining visible UI references to the old brand name with "ProSellers"
- Preserve all instances of the personal name "Mayur Sahu" unchanged

**User-visible outcome:** The entire landing page consistently displays "ProSellers" as the brand/company name while keeping the consultant's personal name intact.
