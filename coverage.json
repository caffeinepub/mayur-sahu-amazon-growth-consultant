Download your free guide now.', the email input field, the gold 'Get Free PDF' CTA button, and the existing success message state on submit. All three boxes must use glassmorphism card styling with gold border accents, consistent with the existing design system. On mobile, the three boxes must stack vertically. The section heading 'Book Your Free 30-Minute Amazon Growth Strategy Call' and supporting text must remain at the top of the section. Retain the section's slightly lighter background (#0D1526) and gold accent top border.",
