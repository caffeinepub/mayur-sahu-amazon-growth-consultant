(2) Render each flag emoji inside a dedicated <span> element with an explicit inline style setting font-family to 'Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Noto Color Emoji, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols, sans-serif' to force proper emoji font fallback on all browsers. Render each country name as a separate plain <span> JSX text node with the string value typed directly — no template literals, no computed values, no character codes. (3) Implement the infinite horizontal scroll by rendering the flag list twice in the DOM (original + duplicate) inside a single flex row container, and animate that container with a CSS @keyframes translateX animation that moves exactly -50% (the width of one full list copy) so the loop is completely gapless with no visible jump. (4) Apply a CSS @keyframes translateY flutter/wave oscillation to each individual flag emoji <span> with staggered animation-delay values (e.g., 0s, 0.15s, 0.3s, etc. cycling through 14 values) so each flag appears to flutter at a different phase. (5) Set overflow: hidden on the outermost container div so no horizontal scrollbar is ever visible.
