      "featureTitle": "Rewrite StrategyCallSection.tsx to replace the current two-column layout with a new single-row layout containing three side-by-side boxes: Box 1 — 'Schedule Your Call' containing the existing Calendly placeholder (bordered box with 'Calendly scheduling widget will appear here' text, styled to match the dark theme), the 'Schedule Call Now' gold CTA button (href: 'https://calendly.com/your-link'), and the WhatsApp 'Chat on WhatsApp' green button (href: 'https://wa.me/918766936874'); Box 2 — 'Send a Message' containing the existing contact form with Name, Email, and Amazon Store URL fields plus a 'Send Message' submit button with the existing submission success state; Box 3 — '7 Profit Killers in Amazon PPC' containing the full content currently in LeadMagnetSection: the description text 'Discover the 7 most common mistakes that drain Amazon PPC budgets — and how to fix them. Download your free guide now.', the email input field, the gold 'Get Free PDF' CTA button, and the existing success message state on submit. All three boxes must use glassmorphism card styling with gold border accents, consistent with the existing design system. On mobile, the three boxes must stack vertically. The section heading 'Book Your Free 30-Minute Amazon Growth Strategy Call' and supporting text must remain at the top of the section. Retain the section's slightly lighter background (#0D1526) and gold accent top border.",
