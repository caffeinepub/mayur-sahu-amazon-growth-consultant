  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of the 11 requirements (REQ-11 through REQ-21). Most sections are added or updated correctly: Hero, Problem, Services, Pricing, Case Studies, Testimonials, About, Why Choose, Strategy Call, Navigation, and global animations. A few minor gaps exist: the Navigation is missing a 'Home' link, the trust badge counters for 'Limited Client Slots' and 'Serving Global Sellers' lack numeric count-up animations, and the step connector is placed between all sections rather than only the specified Problem to Strategy Call pathway.",
