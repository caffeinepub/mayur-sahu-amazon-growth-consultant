  "summary": "Both REQ-49 and REQ-50 appear to be implemented. StrategyCallSection.tsx has been rewritten with a three-box single-row layout (glassmorphism cards, gold borders, mobile stacking), and App.tsx no longer imports or renders LeadMagnetSection. The page flow in App.tsx now reads ComparisonSection → SectionConnector → FAQSection → SectionConnector → StrategyCallSection, which differs slightly from the spec (spec says ComparisonSection → SectionConnector → StrategyCallSection with no LeadMagnetSection in between). The three-box content appears present: Box 1 with Calendly placeholder and WhatsApp button, Box 2 with contact form, Box 3 with 7 Profit Killers lead magnet content. The FAQSection between ComparisonSection and StrategyCallSection appears pre-existing and not introduced by this diff.",
