  "summary": "The diff modifies GlobalServiceSection.tsx, but the implementation uses a 'code' field (e.g., 'us', 'gb', 'ca', 'au') instead of an 'emoji' string containing the actual flag emoji character. The file is truncated, so it is unclear whether the flag emojis are rendered in a <span> with explicit inline font-family styles. Based on available evidence, the country data array does not contain an 'emoji' field with the actual flag emoji characters as required. Country name strings appear to be hard-coded plain literals. Glassmorphism card styling and scroll-triggered animations appear retained.",

      "id": "REQ-48",
      "requirement": "Define country objects with an 'emoji' string field containing the actual flag emoji character, not a 'code' string abbreviation.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the countries array uses a 'code' field (values: 'us', 'gb', 'ca', 'au') instead of an 'emoji' field containing the actual flag emoji character. This directly violates the requirement for zero reliance on Unicode abbreviations or character codes.",

      "requirement": "Render each flag emoji inside a dedicated <span> element with an explicit inline style setting font-family to 'Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Noto Color Emoji, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols, sans-serif'.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated and does not show the JSX render output. Since the data array uses 'code' strings rather than emoji characters, it is likely the emoji rendering with required font-family inline style is not implemented as specified.",
